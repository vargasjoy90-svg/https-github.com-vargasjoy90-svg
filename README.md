🛰️ Astrolite + IA
The Cloudflare for Space. Trust as a Service for the New Space Economy.
Astrolite is not an app. It is a critical infrastructure platform that sits between your space assets and your ground station to answer one question in real-time: Can we trust this signal?

🚀 The Problem We Solve
The new space economy is built on data, but the void between satellite and Earth is a battlefield of corrupted signals, interference, and malicious threats. Traditional systems react too late.

We allow you to act at the speed of light.

✨ Our Solution: Trust as a Service, via API
Our platform ingests your raw radio frequency data stream and, in milliseconds, returns a programmatic Trust Verdict.

Our Capability	The Value to You
🛡️ Zero-Trust Security	Cryptographically verify every signal, eliminating the risk of spoofing attacks.
🧠 Behavioral Analysis	Our analysis engine detects subtle telemetry anomalies that indicate hardware failure or silent cyberattacks.
🔗 Absolute Data Reliability	We reconstruct damaged data packets in real-time, ensuring you never lose critical information due to a bad connection.
 
🏗️ How It Works: An API-First Platform
We don't sell hardware. We don't sell complex software to install. We sell access to a simple, RESTful API.

Ingest your data to our /v1/ingest endpoint.

Receive a Trust Verdict from our /v1/verdicts endpoint.

Build your own solutions on top of our trust infrastructure.

Our self-service model allows any developer to integrate aerospace-grade security into their system in under 5 minutes.

🛠️ Project Status
Functional MVP: The core microservices architecture (V13) is complete.

Verified Build: The system is automatically built and tested via our CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions.

Ready to Pilot: We are actively seeking our first design partners to validate our API in a production environment.
